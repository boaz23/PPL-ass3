Code base for assignment 3 in PPL course.
This assignment was about ASTs (abstract syntax trees) and an interpreted evaluation of a scheme program.
The second part of the assignment transform an L4 program (a subset of Scheme) to a mermaid graph AST which represents the L4 AST.
We also had to convert the mermaid AST to the concreate syntax of mermaid.
The third part of the assignment was about implementing a normal order environment based interpreter for L4.
